 *  -- Java Program to convert "Numbers" in resources/input.txt file to their
 *     their respective British English Words.
 *
 *  -- I've put a lot of effort in keeping this code Flexible, Robust and Reusable
 *     while adhering to OO Design.
 * 
 *  -- The Solid principles have been applied by me throughout the project wherever
 *     it made sense to me.
 *
 *  -- Example of future updates to the software that'll be very easy to implement in code
 *   - Change of input Method (This version of code uses java.util.Scanner class to read
 *     input)
 *   - Change in the logic of decoding will just require creating a new object of class that
 *     implements the interface INumberToWordProcessor and injecting it into decoder object below.
 *   - Processing numbers much higher than 999,999,999
 *
 *  Any feedback is welcome.
